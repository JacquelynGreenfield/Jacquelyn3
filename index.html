	<h3>Why The Whites Needs To Understand Cultural Appropriation</h3>
    
    <p>So today, in one of my journalism classes, we talked about cultural appropriation. It seemed fitting because Halloween just passed and thats usually the time of year we're people like to use "cultures as costumes." And as disturbing as that is, cultural appropriation goes beyond than just Halloween and even clothing and hair styles.

    There has been recent debates over if using different cultural aspects in different forms of expression, such as art, literature and music is cultural appropriation or not.

    Personally, if you have to ask yourself that question, then yes it is. And I understand the many viewpoints on this subject, and the argument that no one really "owns" a culture. But the fact is, cultural appropriation is a real thing, no matter your argument.

    First off, like I said before , if you have to ask yourself if what you want to do could be seen as offensive to that race, gender, religion and culture, then it probably is. And if you still decide you want to take that route and do what you've been planning to do, the proper way to do it is to learn about that culture. DO YOUR RESEARCH! Ask questions, talk to people, UNDERSTAND the group of people that you want to represent, and when you do make sure they are represented properly. Now after you've done your research and have learned everything that is possible to learn, you have to ask for permission. Reach out to that community and ask if they would be offended by what you want to do/create. At the end of the day, the community that you're trying to portray can't fell offended by the work you want to put out, because in the end it is a representation of themselves.

    The second thing is understanding where that frustration comes from when a group of people feel like their culture has been stolen from them. For a long time white America has had it's fair share in mistreating marginalized groups of people. With that being said, the same traditions and aspects of culture you want to write about, or paint about or rap about, are the same traditions and aspects of culture that white America has used to create stereotypes, denied people from their rights, and has pretty much bullied people into marginalized groups. So try to understand if we're not so willing to share the culture that you've criticized for years. Try to understand if we seem uptight about certain issues. Try to understand why I get pissed when I see people like Kim Kardashian wearing cornrows, and fashion magazines calling it high fashion. When in actuality, those same cornrows are probably a reason why a young Black girl won't be able to get a job because her hair seems unprofessional and will get bullied at school because her hair is different from the other white kids. When all she was doing was just maintaining her beautiful curl pattern.

    So after all that, the bottom line is, if you think it's offensive it probably is but if you're going to do it anyway, check your white privilege, and try to make an effort to understand another race, gender, religion or cultures feelings.</P>
