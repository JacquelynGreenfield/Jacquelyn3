	<h3>Lessons From My Mother</h3>
    
    <p>I was eleven years old when I had my first kiss. It was right after my math class in the main hallway of one of the school’s building. His name was Bryan Rodriguez and we were only “dating” for four days. We actually broke up in that same math class minutes before. And I only kissed him because he thought I was “too pussy” to do it in the first place. I don’t remember if we got back together afterwards or not. I do remember he tried to put his tongue in my mouth and I was genuinely disgusted.</p>
	    
	<p> I never told my mother that it happened. I honestly can’t remember how she found out, I think it was my nosey ass brother. Anyway, she was livid! I honestly think she started crying. She kept yelling at me in her Jamaican accent, “You’re too young! You’re too young!” In her mind I was full blown making out with this dude. Our tongues down each other's throats, my arms draped around his neck, his hands running up and down my backside, the whole nine yards! So looking back on it I can understand why she was upset. I did tell her she was overreacting and that it was a “pop” kiss, which it was. She did calm down slightly but she was very infuriated. </p>
	
	    
<p>The reason why I am telling this story is because from this moment on, my mother and I we’re constantly discussing boys and how I wasn’t allowed to date them until I was sixteen. Every single one of my friends had their little middle school boyfriends and cute relationships that lasted five weeks at max, and I just wouldn’t dare to think about it because I was genuinely too scared of my mother and God, (in that order.) I would beg and plead with her and tell her “I’m not too young! So and so’s mom lets her date!” and she would reply, “I’m not so and so’s mom, I’m your mom and the answer is NO! You’ll get your heart broken” We would go back and forth like this until I was sixteen when my mother gave me a choice: a boy or a car.</p>
	<p>I got my first car two months after my sixteenth birthday, I named it Syd, (inspired by Syd tha Kid from The Internet.) It was a 2003 yellow Volkswagen Beetle with tan leather seats and a sun roof. It even had a plastic flower holder that I put pink synthetic flowers in. </p>
	<p>So it would be another two years until I was allowed to date anyone. At the time I was cool with that. None of the boys that went to my school wanted to date me because I was Black, I was just good enough to fuck, and I definitely wasn’t cool with that! I used to say that I couldn’t wait to move to New York so I could find my husband. And what do you know almost two years later I did. Well he’s not my husband, (yet, fingers crossed!) but my boyfriend of three years. And I can honestly say, I love him, with all of my heart. </p>
	<p>I love this man so much that it actually fucking scares me sometimes. I’m still in shock how much I care for this person who isn’t my flesh and blood. I would take a bullet for this man. Isn’t that wild? The love I have for him is so real, yet so indescribable. Imagine that, you have this intense feeling inside of you that you can’t formulate into words. It’s kinda like screaming the lyrics to “Weak” by SWV at the top of  your lungs, adlibs and everything. (Which is what I do) You could change your whole view on life because of this one person. You become a completely different person yourself because of them. This person can consume all of your thoughts and time that you can’t remember life before them, nor do you want to. The love can be so fucking deep that you have to ask yourself, “is this borderline obsession?” And you know what, it very well can be. And that’s ok, (sometimes!)</p>
	<p>But the point I am trying to make here is that no one is ever really ready for that feeling. Ever since I was eleven years old, my mother has tried to shield and protect me from getting my heart broken. Knowing what some young girls, even some of my close friends, have done when they got their heart broken, and she couldn’t bare to see me go through that. She used to tell me “you’re too young to experience heartbreak, you’re not ready.” Telling me that I would be ready when I was older. </p>
<p>Looking back on it, I don’t think my mother was trying to protect me from heartbreak, but rather falling in love. Falling in love with my father, her first love, and then getting divorced after three children, she must have been scared shitless of the thought that I might have to go through that one day. People say that your first love is always the hardest to get over, but no one ever talks about how hard you fall in love in the first place. There was no way in hell that my eleven year old self, or even my sixteen year old self could possibly handle the feelings I have now for another person. Shit, I don’t think I can handle these feelings at the age I am now. I know that what my mother was doing all those years ago was for my own benefit. And I thank her everyday that she told me to wait to feel this marvelous, wonderful, terrifying feeling.</p>
